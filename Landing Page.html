                <p>In digital marketing, a landing page is a web page that is displayed in response to clicking on a
                  search result, marketing promotion, email marketing or an ad on Facebook or the like.</p>
                <p>In general, this type of page aims to allow the visitor to contact the company that owns the
                  landing to obtain more information about a product or to directly buy it. You can also aim to have
                  the visitor register himself for the use of a product. This visitor's action is called a
                  “conversion” and one of the main metrics used in digital marketing is the conversion rate, that
                  is, of the total number of users visiting a landing, how many convert.</p>
                <p>According to a study by <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/">SmartInsights</a> the best
                  landings convert at rates of up to 27%. However, if the average is calculated, it falls much
                  lower, with most industries experiencing conversion rates between 2 and 6 percent. This means that
                  there is plenty of room to increase conversion rates in most industries.</p>
                <p>If a company is spending $ 5,000 on digital advertising to attract potential customers to its
                  landing page, but it has a conversion rate of 2%, it means it is wasting much of its budget. If
                  this company invested $ 500 in optimizing their landing page and thus increased their conversion
                  rate to 4%, they would need to invest only $ 2,500 in digital advertising to get exactly the same
                  results.</p>
                <p>An example of the sales funnel of a typical landing page could be the following:</p>
                <div class="text-center mb-4 blogpost-image">
                  <img src="images/funnel.png" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
                <p>In this case, only 10% of those who enter the website "convert" (get in touch to get the
                  product). If somehow 15% of conversions (750 contacts) could be reached, it would reach 23
                  customers.</p>
                <p>Increasing the conversion rate increases the funnel base, which in general translates into an
                  increase in sales and therefore in the company's revenues.</p>
                <p>The problem of optimizing or trying to increase the conversion rate of a website is known as
                  "Conversion Rate Optimization" (CRO).</p>
                <h2>A/B testing for landing pages</h2>
                <p>One of the main objectives of digital marketing is to convert people who visit the company's
                  website into customers. To achieve this, landing pages are created where a brief description of
                  the product is shown with a striking design and in general with a button (call to action) to click
                  that allows you to buy the product or contact the sales department.</p>
                <p>While there are lists with “good practices” to create the design of these landing pages, these
                  good practices won’t necessarily work with your target audience. The best way to design a landing
                  page that converts is to base your design decisions on real-world data of your real audience.</p>
                <p>A technique commonly used to increase the conversions of a web page is called A/B testing. Doing
                  an A/B test consists of creating a variation B of the original page A, exposing both to site
                  visitors and measuring which of the two has the highest conversion rate. Usually a statistical
                  analysis determines whether one is better than the other with a previously chosen level of
                  confidence. Variation B can be made up of small changes (for example changing the color of a
                  button) or a complete redesign of the page. Once the A/B test is finished, you can either leave
                  only the winning variation or perform a new A/B test to find an even better variation than the one
                  already found.</p>
                <p>An extension of the A/B tests is the multivariate test where instead of comparing only 2
                  variations, more are done and all are compared at the same time.</p>
                <p>To perform an A/B test correctly on a web page you must, once a visitor arrives on the page, have
                  an algorithm that quickly chooses what the variation to be displayed. Once that variation is
                  chosen for that visitor, the choice must be remembered and therefore if the same person enters the
                  same page after a while, the same variation must be shown.</p>
                <p>Most big companies do A/B testing on their landing pages with huge success but the process can be
                  complicated and require a lot of expertise to get it right. That’s why we created ABtesting.ai.
                </p>
                <p>ABtesting.ai automatically suggests and executes A/B tests on your landing page. It requires no
                  knowledge about A/B testing and it can work in an unattended way. You just need to do the initial
                  setup and our AI algorithm will find the best variation of your landing page that optimizes the
                  conversion rate.</p>

                <h2>Main Things to A/B test on Landing Pages</h2>
                <h3>The Headline</h3>
                <p>The headline is usually the first thing that a visitor reads and is your first opportunity to
                  engage your target customer. If you get this part wrong, chances are that the visitor will leave
                  the page without checking anything else. So, even if the landing has the coolest design and the
                  product you are trying to sell is awesome, if you can’t communicate what your product is for in a
                  few words, no one will pay attention to the rest (yeah, life is hard).</p>
                <p>The best way to find out which is the headline that works best, is to run A/B tests to compare
                  how effective they are. Using ABtesting.ai you can set up these tests in just 3 minutes to try to
                  optimize your conversion rate.</p>
                <h3>The Copy</h3>
                <p>The copy is what immediately follows the headline, it should be something that complements the
                  headline’s message and expands on it a bit. Depending on your target audience, you will need to
                  use more formal or informal wording, and it will be hard to know what works without trying it out.
                </p>
                <h3>The Call To Action</h3>
                <p>The “call to action” (CTA) is the button that you want the visitor to press so it will contact
                  the sales department or directly buy your product. It’s the most important piece of your landing,
                  should be visible all the time and must be clear about what’s the action that you want the visitor
                  to perform. For example, texts to try out are “sign up”, “try for free”, etc. Never use something
                  like “click here”. You can do A/B tests to determine what’s the best background color, font size
                  and text. Changing the background color of your CTA might improve your conversion rate up to 20%!
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Performing A/B testing on your landing page can increase your conversion rate and drive up your
                  revenue. Using ABtesting.ai you can do this in no time and for a fraction of the money that you
                  will get in return for increasing your conversion rate. ABtesting.ai won’t charge until it’s able
                  to find a variation of your landing that has a higher conversion rate than the original one. Are
                  you ready to try it out?</p>
